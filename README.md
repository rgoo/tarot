# tarot
A basic drupal module that generates a past-present-future tarot card reading.

The master branch is functional and ready for use on d7 installations.

## Installation
1. clone repo to /sites/all/modules/
2. enable the module at yoursite.com/admin/modules
3. navigate to yousite.com/tarot


## ToDo
* add admin configuration
* register theme functions/create tpl files 
* allow users to save their readings for future reference (I may upload the code I already have for this to a dev branch)
